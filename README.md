# Microbial and Soil Diversity Study for Predicting Land Use
**LUCAS European Project**

## Team: Merrier Microbes - Alice, Krupa, Roc, and Marcellus
### Event: Gradient0 - Life Sciences Hackathon (December 2023)

## Project Overview

### Microbial Profiling

- Align microbial sequence data
- Determine functional pathway enrichment to explore differences between land use systems.

### Model 1: Soil Features Across Time Vs. Land Use

Identify soil features predictive of land use over time and examine their impact on microbial diversity and function.

### Model 2: Soil + Bacterial Features Vs. Land Use

Determine the relative importance of soil and microbial features in predicting land use.
