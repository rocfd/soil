### Project Overview

**Microbial profiling:**    

Align microbial sequence data and determine functional pathway enrichment to explore differences between land use systems.

**Model 1: Soil Features Accross Time Vs. Land Use**    

Identify Soil Features Predictive of Land Use Over Time and how they affect microbial diversity and function.

**Model2: Soil + Bacterial Features Vs. Land Use**    

Determine the relative importance of soil and microbial features in predicting land use.
